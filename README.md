## Project Overview

The Titanic competition on Kaggle is a classic machine learning challenge. The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to ensure the following prerequisites:

- Create a Kaggle account.
- Install the Kaggle API and configure Kaggle API credentials. Instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/blob/main/docs/).

### Download the data

Once you have the Kaggle API and credentials configured, you can download the competition data by running:

```
kaggle competitions download -c titanic
```

Unzip the data into the data folder, remove the original zip archive, and you are ready to go:
```
unzip titanic.zip -d data/
rm titanic.zip
```
